# Vue Custom Web Component

> This is a stand-alone tutorial and can be used as a starting point for every next project that requires embedable widget to be placed on any web app. It is a fresh, default Vue CLI 3 instance. It is only encapsulated within HTML custom web component.

To make Vue.js application embedable as a widget anywhere using only one **app.js** and one **app.css** file we create a custom web component. We will use [vue-custom-element](https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element), which allows to render our Vue.js application as an HTML custom element like `<my-app></my-app>`.

**Hint:** there is an official [Vue web component wrapper](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper) available, however I found **vue-custom-element** as a project with more active development conducted by its contributors.

**Other dependencies and libraries used:**

* [document-register-element](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element) - a stand-alone working lightweight version of the W3C Custom Elements specification, a custom polyfill in order for our HTML custom element to work.

**Let's start!**

## Create a project

At first, use Vue CLI command `vue create vue-web-component` or run `vue ui` in terminal to start GUI in the browser and create a project there. You will be prompted to pick a preset. You can either choose the default preset which comes with a basic Babel + ESLint setup, or select "Manually select features" to pick the features you need.

> For more information about how to create a project using Vue CLI please refer to [documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create). To start this project we are using basic set of features, please see `package.json` of base [vue-web-component](https://github.com/sebastiansledz/vue-web-component) repository for details.

## Optimize application as an HTML custom element

This is what **vue-custom-element** is for. It’s a wrapper for our Vue.js application and allows to invoke it in the source code via custom HTML element.

run ```npm install vue-custom-element --save```

and rewrite initializing file `src/main.js` to have it as below

```javascript
// src/main.js

import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'
import vueCustomElement from 'vue-custom-element'

Vue.use(vueCustomElement)

App.router = router
Vue.customElement('vue-widget', App)
```

We are not using `new Vue()` anymore. Calling `Vue.customElement()` is doing it for us — and we provide the widget name (`<vue-widget></vue-widget>` in HTML) in the first argument and our App component in the second argument.

**Warning:** Using a name without a dash symbol may not work.

Anything you’d like to include in `new Vue()` before, is supposed to be included in `App` as a property now, calling `Vue.customElement()` after all your setup is done.

## Change index.html

`public/index.html`

We remove our `<div id="app"></div>` and replace it with the new `<vue-widget></vue-widget>`.

**Caution:** For old(er) browsers we need a custom polyfill in order for our HTML custom element to work. Download it and import it in our main.js file.

run `npm install document-register-element --save`

```javascript
// add to src/main.js

import 'document-register-element/build/document-register-element'
```

## Run the build

`npm run build`

Building gives desired source — compressed, neat and small in size. But in case we are developing a larger app, we may experience having dozens of .js chunk files in our dist (build) folder. We wanted a single app.js file that could be imported in other sites and not fourty-one 1–3 kB .js files.

## Disable chunks

Create a **vue.config.js** file in the root of our application (next to the package.json). This is where webpack config is written in Vue CLI 3.

We will use webpack **LimitChunkCountPlugin** plugin and pass the config to delete split chunks.

```javascript
// vue.config.js

const webpack = require('webpack')
module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new webpack.optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({
        maxChunks: 1
      })
    ]
  },
  filenameHashing: false,
  chainWebpack:
    config => {
      config.optimization.delete('splitChunks');
    }
}
```

## Run build

`npm run build`

The build should contain only single **app.js** and single **app.css** file.

## Host the source

Put whole build source - everything in the **/dist** folder - to root of desired domain, example used: `https://vuiget-source.sledz.xyz`

If we are using fonts or images, they are included in the build folder **(/dist)** and bound in the style and script files - **app.js** and **app.css** files are seeking those assets.

To make them accessible for external sources we may need to add header to our domain configuration like .htaacess as below:

```
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
```

## Embed the widget

When all the needed assets are uploaded to source domain include **app.js** and **app.css** file in the site where you want to display the widget. Please see example below.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
 <!-- widget source css -->
 <link href="https://vuiget-source.sledz.xyz/css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
 <vue-widget title="Vue Web Component"></vue-widget>
 <!-- widget source js -->
 <script src="https://vuiget-source.sledz.xyz/js/app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
